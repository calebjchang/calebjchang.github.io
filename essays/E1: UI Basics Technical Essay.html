  <p>Before I went began the WODs, I made sure to go through each of the provided readings, despite my lack of comprehension, but I did gain a sense of familiarity, essentially learning what is possible and how commands/tags generally take place in HTML.</p>

<p>I didn’t have any prior knowledge in any coding language, and even after going through the readings I had still no idea yet on how to apply the information from the readings yet. Because of this, before I began BrowserHistory1, I went through the readings and the instructions to figure out which commands I needed to use and how to use each tag. I then completed it once but forgot to record, in Av time, and completed in Rx on my second try. It was fairly easy but took a while as it incorporated adding many different elements to the webpage.</p>

<p>After completing BrowserHistory1 and going through the lab in class, my familiarity with HTML was much higher than before, so I used similar strategies to get ready for BrowserHistory2 and 3. Despite this however, I ran into big issues on both, and took multiple tries to complete the in Rx time. Although it wasn’t time-consuming or particularly difficult, there were things I had no clue on how to make. Even when I was going through the HTML reading, I couldn’t quite figure out which tag would place the image in line with the text. After trying on my own and researching, I couldn’t find the right tag. I then watched the screencast and learned the float tag. I had ended up overcomplicating a bit and didn’t even consider it. Now that I knew what it does, I was able to complete the screencast very quickly.</p>

<p>On that same note, for BrowserHistory3, I got stuck on the three column part, and thereafter making sure they were all in inline, as well as making the navbar in line. Because I went so far and was so lost after my first try, I decided to watch the screencast example. After learning which tag to use, I was able to complete it in time. What helped me the most was the prep stage before attempting each WOD, as kind of a test run for the tags I’d be using. I would definitely say that waiting to watch the screencast was a better decision over watching it before attempting.</p>

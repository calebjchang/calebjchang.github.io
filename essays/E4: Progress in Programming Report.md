### My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:
Once I finally completed Assignment1, I felt that I made very great strides in my coding skills. After going through all the modules up until this point, a lot of smaller things that used to be difficult and errors that took me awhile to find and rework came a lot easier. Although I still use the internet in order to find things I don't know or want to implement in my code. I also got better at using the resources I have available to me, by knowing where to go to find the information I need. I also improved on using comments to help myself understand my code, although from a harsh realization and advice from upperclassmen. 

### I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:
I realized a lot of my shortcomings when I took on Assignment1. My previous assumptions of the assignment was that although it'd be difficult to implement the data validation on the server; it was for the most part putting the pieces of the Store1 WOD and server work from Lab12. I was sorely mistaken and I began working with only a few days left to spare. Although I was able to complete Assignment1 a day early with help from upperclassmen and ChatGPT, I was severely lacking in my understanding of the server-side processing. This basically crippled me in my development of the server and made it extremely difficult to move forward with my server without ensuring everything was done correctly. There is another thing that is a bit smaller, but I'd like to improve my typing skills as a whole, both WPM and accuracy, just so that my coding skills aren't lacking mechanically.

### I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast:
I have most definitely learned a lot from doing the WODs and I do think I'll be able to complete all of the WODs without copying the screencast, but I admit that I would most likely need a refresher for certain niche parts of the WODs. I did enjoy the WODs and I was able to complete nearly all of them under Rx time with proper preparation beforehand. It was easy to complete WODs when I had a thorough understanding of the concept at hand, but more difficult when it dealt with concepts I wasn't sure on.

### The labs have help me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence:
The labs were 1000% very useful in helping me learn new concepts. Almost every single lab gave knowledge that I still am utilizing in WODs and Assignment1, and helped me to understand each piece of code that went into creating a larger picture. I did struggle a lot with the on-your-own portions with the labs, with the concepts I lacked a strong understanding in. This was less of a lack of understanding and more of a total lack of knowledge on how the concepts worked. I often skipped readings and screencasts, which was probably my biggest downfall in completing the labs on my own.

### I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2:
Assignment1 was a big wakeup call and definitely the most difficult but the most rewarding thing I've ever made. In two sittings, I worked on my code from 3pm to 3am one night, where I struggled  and struggled and finally was able to get my code to work properly. Even with help from peers and the usage of ChatGPT, it seemed that sometimes the more I added to try to fix, the more I exacerbated the issue. It was a moment where the advice from Professor Port on taking things one at time truly came in handy. The most surprising thing was that I learned how complicated, rewarding, and difficult CSS could be. I took inspiration for my website from another and when I looked through all the HTMl and the CSS on that website, I was discouraged in the sheer amount of code, but in awe of how far CSS could be pushed. I do feel ready to work on Assignment2, but I feel like the more I underestimate the work needed to complete it, the more I'll struggle on Assignment3.

### I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:


### What helped me the most in class are (WODs, Labs, class website, screencasts, readings, quizzes, one on one help, working with classmates, etc.):

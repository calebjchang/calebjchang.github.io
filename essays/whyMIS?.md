Deciding on my major was very difficult and was a process that began from even before high school. My father worked as a car salesman and worked his up way the ladder, and my mother was a stay-at-home mom who eventually moved on to a career in real estate. My older brother graduated with a Bachelor of Music with a focus in composition and my older sister is a Japanese language major. I wasn't sure what to choose and after speaking with my peers, my family, my friends, and many others, I decided to pursue a B.B.A in MIS. As the internet continually advances and grows, a higher level of understanding and proficiency with coding, development, and similar areas, will become more valuable. Even if MIS isn't the field I eventually pursue a career in, I hope to gain a lot of knowledge and experience through ITM 352.
